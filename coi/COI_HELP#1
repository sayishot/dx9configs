try disabling VPNs or disabling HWID spoofers as they can cause s12 errors, another thing that can cause it is network adapters, set them to manual and not auto. its basically a firewall when it changes the DNS every hour or so.

RULES
------------------------------------------


#1: Be respectful to other members, regardless of their roles (applies to staff also)


#2: Any form of NSFW content (including reactions) whether distributed in the server or in the DMS of another member, is not allowed. What is deemed NSFW can be subjective, so it'll be up to staff to determine whether the content is and give the appropriate punishment afterwards - [ its higher up in this ]


#3: Refrain from mass pinging staff members, especially for when it's not an emergency - [ ping staff (yourself as some allow pinging) = ";warn @USER pinging staff" ]


#4: Spamming/cluttering of any sort in this server can come with consequences, don't do it, at least excessively. - [ spamming in chat = ";mute @USER 400 spamming in chat" ]


#5 Keep yourself and others safe by not posting confidential information or software that can put others at risk. This means that:

â—¾ MALWARE-PACKED SOFTWARE, 
â—¾ MALICIOUS LINKS,
â—¾ DOXES/IP ADDRESSES
are not to be posted. - [ up to the higher rank staff members to decide, please @ them if there is proof of this being shown then you can do ";mute @USER 400 leaking info or stealing info"]


#6: Unless you're given permission from staff, you're not allowed to advertise, not in DMs either. Advertising via usernames is also not permitted


#7: When expected, and in serious cases, obey staff and do what you're told


#8: You will not raid or promote any raid, especially that are targeted at Cult of Intellect


#9: Use channels for their intended use [ speaking in a media channel = ";mute @USER 300" 300-400 300 is minimum. ]


#10: Refrain from scamming/doxing/cookie/token logging any of our members


#11: Do not snitch on others, especially buyers who haven't granted you permission, for being here


#12: Bypassing any punishment by (for example) making alternative accounts or rejoining, is prohibited and will only worsen the punishment.


#13: The impersonation of anyone here, especially staff members and owners, is not allowed, unless you're given permission.


#14: Do not misinform users about Cult of Intellect and its products. Doing so can result in bad outcomes.


#15: Protect the health of yourself and others by not screaming in voice channels - [ screaming in vc/ear raping is ";warn @USER screaming in vc" ]
